<h2>About our Final Project</h2>

<p>This project is worked on by Bandar and Nithya. We will be using a dataset on Crimes in Vancouver.</p>

<l>Our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the crime rates between different neighbourhoods.</l>
<l>Our alternate hypothesis is that there will be a difference in crime rates between different neighbourhoods.</l>

<p>For this project we plant to clean the data first. Then, we are going to run an Anova Test, Multiple Linear Regression using OLS, and KNN on the dataset. Then, for data visualization we are going to use a pie chart, bar chart, and histogram to determine the difference in crime rates in different neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Our findings indicated that there was a difference in crime rates in different neighbourhoods. The highest number of crimes occurred in Central Business District and the lowest occurred in Musqueam. Also, Theft from Vehicle had the highest percentage of occurrence</p>
