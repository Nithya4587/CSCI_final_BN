<h2>About this Project</h2>

<p>This project is being worked on by Nithya and Bandar. The goal of this project is to find if there will be a difference in crime rates between different neighbourhoods in Vancouver. To approach this problem, we are using data charts such as a pie chart, bar chart, and a histogram, as well as machine learning programs such as KNN, Multiple Linear Regression with OLS, and Anova Testing.</p>

<p>This repo contains all our work for this project.</p>
